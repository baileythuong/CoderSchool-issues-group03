# CoderSchool FTW - Github Issues
#### Group 03: Ricardo, Hansol, Artine, Thương, Phong
Live demo [here](#).

Our team have built a Github user-friendly API. It's well designed and familiarizing ourselves with it is a good way to get started on one day building out own APIs.

## Features
- [x] The user can enter a repository in a search bar, click "search", and see the associated issues. The repository should be of the format `owner/repo-name`, e.g. `facebook/react`.
- [x] Issue Title
- [x] Number of the issue
- [x] Owner of the Issue
- [x] Owner Avatar
- [x] How long ago the issue was created in a human-friendly format (e.g. 2 days ago)
- [x] Body of the Issue
- [x] Label - note the `color` as returned by the API.
- [x] State of Issue (Open/Closed).
- [x] The user should be able to see multiple pages of results, by clicking a pagination control.
- [x] The user should be able to see the body of the issue rendered in markdown.
- [x] The user can see more details (including comments!) in a modal that's opened by clicking on the title of the issue.
