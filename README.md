Our team have built a Github user-friendly API. It's well designed and familiarizing ourselves with it is a good way to get started on one day building out own APIs.

## Required Features
- [] The user can enter a repository in a search bar, click "search", and see the associated issues. The repository should be of the format owner/repo-name, e.g. facebook/react.
- [] If the repository does not exist, the user should see a proper error message.
- [x] Issue Title
- [x] Number of the issue
- [x] Owner of the Issue
- [x] Owner Avatar
- [x] How long ago the issue was created in a human-friendly format (e.g. 2 days ago)
- [x] Body of the Issue
- [] Label - note the color as returned by the API.
- [x] State of Issue (Open/Closed).
- [x] The user should be able to see multiple pages of results, by clicking a pagination control.
